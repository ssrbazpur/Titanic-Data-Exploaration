This notebook is a simple example of titanic Disaster in python. It is a Kaggle Competition, [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). It is good for those who are going into the field of Machine learning, Data Analysis or simple introduction to the Kaggle Prediction competition.

## Dependencies

1) pandas.
2) numpy.
3) matplotlib.
4) math.
5) sklearn.
6) scipy.

## This notebook tells us how to :
 
1) Import the data.<br/>
2) Describe the data.<br/>
3) Clean the data.<br/>
4) Visualize it's features.<br/>
5) Select features.<br/>
6) Apply Machine Learning Algorithm, like Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and evaluate its model's accuracy, using confusion matrix.<br/>
7) Apply Machine Learning Algorithm from scratch, like Logistic regression, to Titanic Dataset.<br/>
8) Prepare the predicted data for Kaggle Submission.
